# pc-monitoring-app
An app to collect data on your pc (cpu usage, heat sensors, ram usage, running apps...) and sends it to a dashbord that displays it all elegantly is a seperate device. I use a tablet that i put in my desk next to my computer and it displays the dashboard with all the data i need.
